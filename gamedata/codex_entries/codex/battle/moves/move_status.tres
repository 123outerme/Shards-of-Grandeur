The status chance displayed in the Move Details screen describes the base chance to afflict the status, before being modified by the attacker's Affinity and the defender's Affinity. If the attacker has higher Affinity, the status will be more likely to land. A status with a base 100% chance to land will always land, regardless of the defender's Affinity."
