description = "Surge Moves have stronger effects, but cost Orbs. Each Surge Move requires some amount of Orbs to be able to use. They get bonuses for every Orb spent above the minimum. You can find the Surge Effect of a Move in its Details.

For example, a Surge Move might cost 3 Orbs to use, but increase the attack power of the move. Then, for every Orb the user spends above 3, that move would gain some additional power!"
